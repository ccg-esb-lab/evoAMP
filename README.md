## Data analysis

Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the following figures can be found in [evoAMP/code/py-files/runEvoAMP.ipynb](evoAMP/code/py-files/runEvoAMP.ipynb)

**Figue 1:** Adaptive ramp with different strengths of selection<br>
**Figue 2:** Evaluating the stability of resistance of populations evolved under different selection regimes<br>
**Figue 4:** Rate of adaptation when antibiotics are reintroduced into the environment depends on previous drug exposures<br>

## Mathematical model

Matlab scripts used to generate the modelling figures can be found in [evoAMP/code/m-files/](evoAMP/code/m-files/)

**Figure 5:** Numerical simulations of the population dynamics model<br>
