## Data analysis

Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the following figures can be found in [code/py-files/runEvoAmp.ipynb](https://github.com/ccg-esb-lab/evoAMP/blob/main/code/py-files/runEvoAmp.ipynb)

**Figue 1A:** Resistance as a function of time in adaptive ramps with different strengths of selection<br>
**Figue 1C:** Rate of adaptation estimated for each replicate<br>
**Figue 2C & 2C:** Reduction in resistance measured daily during counter-selection<br>
**Figue 4A:** Rate of adaptation when antibiotics are reintroduced into the environment depends on previous drug exposures<br>
**Figue S1:** Normalized resistance during all phases of the evolutionary experiment<br>
**Figue S3:** Maximum growth rate estimated for sequenced clones from growth kinetic curves<br>
**Figue S4:** Relative fitness of populations sampled at the end of PHASE 1 compared to a susceptible strain<br>
**Figue S5:** MIC estimated for each evolved population at the end of each phase<br>
**Figue S7:** Frequency of IS-mediated mutations during the evolutionary experiment<br>

## Mathematical model

Numerical simulations of the population dynamics model were performed in Matlab, with scripts that can be found in [evoAMP/code/m-files/](evoAMP/code/m-files/)

**Figue 2A:** Reduction in resistance after counter-selection<br>
**Figue 5:** Numerical simulations of the population dynamics model<br>
**Figue S9:** Stability of resistance is associated with the level of resistance<br>
**Figue S10:** Interaction between strength of selection and rate of adaptation under different bottleneck scenarios<br>
